"""
The CCCC module contains a number of classes for reading various cross section,
flux, geometry, and data files with specifications given by the Committee for
Computer Code Coordination. The following types of files can be read using
classes from this module: ISOTXS, DLAYXS, BRKOXS, RTFLUX, ATFLUX, RZFLUX, MATXS,
and SPECTR.

The ISOTXS reader was originally derived from Professor James Holloway's
open-source C++ classes from the University of Michigan and later expanded by
Nick Touran for work on his PhD thesis. DLAYXS was later added by Paul Romano.

A description of several CCCC formats are available online for ISOTXS_, MATXS_,
RTFLUX_, and RZFLUX_. Other format specifications can be found in Los Alamos
Report LA-5324-MS_.
