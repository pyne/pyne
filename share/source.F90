! This is Fortran90 code that can be compiled directly into MCNP5 in order
! to use the mesh-based sampling capabilities provided by the Sampler class
! within source_sampling.cpp. The subroutine "source" calls the MCNP5 interface 
! C++ functions within source_sampling.cpp. The function "find_cell"
! determines what geomety cell a sampled x, y, z are in, which allows for
! void rejection within the source subroutine. Void rejection ensures that 
! particles are never born in void (which is non-physical) which may arise in
! the case of source density meshes that are non-conformal to the geometry
! (e.g. most Cartesean meshes). This version of find_cell does not work for
! repeated geometries or universes. 
!
! Full instructions on compiling and using MCNP5 with this subroutine are found
! in the PyNE user manual.

function find_cell() result(icl_tmp)
! This function to determines the current MCNP cell index location and exits if
! no valid cell is found. This only works if there are no repeated geometries or
! universes present in the model.
