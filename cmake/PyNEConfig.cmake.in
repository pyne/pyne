# PyNEConfig.cmake
# 
# Configuration file for integrating PyNE with CMake projects.
# This script finds the Python interpreter, ensures its availability,
# and retrieves necessary PyNE details such as version, include paths, 
# and library paths. It also verifies that the Python environment is 
# properly set up for PyNE and checks for potential compatibility issues.

# This CMake script extracts the following PyNE details:
# - PyNE version (PyNE_VERSION)
# - PyNE include paths (PyNE_INCLUDE_DIRS)
# - PyNE library paths (PyNE_LIBRARY_DIRS)
# - PyNE library (PyNE_LIBRARY or pyne)
# - PyNE libraries (PyNE_LIBRARIES)
# - PyNE extra libraries (PyNE_EXTRA_LIBRARIES)

# Find the Python interpreter and ensure it's available.
