Simple DAGMC test problem

geom.inp - This file was used to create geom.sat with mcnp2cad.
           It specifies a sphere around the origin with material
           number 1 and rho = -1.  The rest of the universe is 
           void.

geom.sat - Output from mcnp2cad.  Note that the added 'graveyard' 
           volume, which mcnp2cad creates by default, is assigned
           volume number 1.  This means the volume numbering in 
           geom.sat is different from that of geom.inp; the f4 tally
           in test.inp reflects this.

test.inp - DAG-MCNP5 test input with simple defaults.  An f4 tally
           is performed on the sphere.

To run this problem in dag-mcnp5, provide the following command line:

   dag-mcnp5 i=test.inp g=geom.sat

You may optionally specify. a faceting tolerance by adding 
   
   ftol=1e-4

or similar to the command line.  See the dagmc documentation [1] for 
more information.
