/**
 * \class KDENeighborhood
 * \brief Defines a neighborhood region for a KDE mesh tally event
 *
 * KDENeighborhood is a class that defines the neighborhood region for a
 * KDEMeshTally as part of a Monte Carlo particle transport simulation.  The
 * neighborhood region is formally defined as the region in space for which
 * the kernel function produces a non-trivial result for any mesh node that
 * exists inside that region.  This set of mesh nodes is also known as the
 * set of calculation points for the KDEMeshTally.
 *
 * In general, it is not always easy to define the exact neighborhood region.
 * Therefore, the default behavior of KDENeighborhood is to use a kd-tree
 * search method to locate all possible calculation points for each TallyEvent.
 * This kd-tree approach produces an exact neighborhood region for collision
 * events, but only an approximation for track-based events.
 *
 * =============================
 * KDENeighborhood Functionality
 * =============================
 *
 * Once a KDENeighborhood has been created, there are two steps that are
 * needed to get its calculation points.  Since the dimensions of the exact
 * neighborhood region usually changes with each TallyEvent, it is first
 * necessary to call update_neighborhood().  Once the neighborhood has been
 * updated, then the set of calculation points associated with that event can
 * be obtained by get_points().
