/**
 * \class PolynomialKernel
 * \brief Defines a polynomial kernel function
 * 
 * PolynomialKernel is a Derived class that implements the KDEKernel interface
 * to create any polynomial kernel function that is defined by a smoothness
 * factor s and kernel order 2r.  The domain of these kernel functions is
 * limited to u = [-1, 1].
 *
 * Common polynomial kernels include uniform (s = 0), epanechnikov (s = 1),
 * biweight (s = 2), and triweight (s = 3).  All of these cases and more can be
 * constructed using the following general formula
 *
 *               (1/2)_s+1
 *      K_s(u) = --------- (1 - u^2)^s
 *                   s!
 *
 * where (1/2)_s+1 is known as the Pochhammer symbol
 *
 *      (x)_n = x(x + 1)(x + 2)...(x + n - 1)
 *
 * Any kernel function based on K_s(u) is said to be of 2nd-order.  Higher-
 * order cases (r > 1) can be derived from these 2nd-order kernels by simply
 * multiplying them with a second polynomial
 *
 *      K_2r,s(u) = B_r,s(u) * K_s(u)
 *
 * For more information on how to construct higher-order kernel functions,
 * please refer to the following reference
 * 
 *     B. E. Hansen, "Exact Mean Integrated Squared Error of Higher Order
 *     "Kernel Estimators," Econometric Theory, 21, pp. 1031-1057 (2005)
