/**
 * \class TrackLengthMeshTally
 * \brief Represents an unstructured mesh tally based on particle tracks
 *
 * TrackLengthMeshTally is a concrete class derived from MeshTally that
 * implements the Tally interface to tally particle tracks on an unstructured
 * mesh as part of a Monte Carlo particle transport simulation.  If a
 * TrackLengthMeshTally object receives a TallyEvent type that is not
 * TallyEvent::TRACK, then no scores are computed.
 *
 * ==========
 * TallyInput
 * ==========
 *
 * The TallyInput struct needed to construct a TrackLengthMeshTally object is
 * defined in Tally.hpp and is set through the TallyManager when a Tally is
 * created.  Options that are currently available for TrackLengthMeshTally
 * objects include
 *
 * 1) "inp"="input_filename", "out"="output_filename"
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * These two options are processed through the MeshTally constructor.  The
 * "inp" key is REQUIRED for TrackLengthMeshTally objects, whereas the "out"
 * key is optional.  See MeshTally.hpp for more information.
 *
 * 2) "convex"="t/f", "convex"="true/false"
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * If the convex option is set to true, the user is asserting that the input
 * mesh has convex geometry.  Single particle tracks that leave a convex mesh
 * are no longer tracked as they cannot re-enter the mesh.  The default value
 * for this option is false.
 *
 * 3) "conformal"="values"
 * -----------------------
 * If the input mesh is exactly conformal to the geometry, then conformal
 * logic should be used for scoring particle tracks across mesh cells or
 * errors may occur. This option allows the user to identify what geometric
 * cells are conformal to the input mesh.  These values can be defined as a
 * list of cells separated by commas (i.e. 1, 2, 5), and/or a range of cells
 * (i.e. 2-5).  Like the convex case, particle tracks that leave a conformal
 * mesh are no longer tracked.
 *
 * 4) "conf_surf_src"="t/f", "conf_surf_src"="true/false"
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * If the conformal surface source option is set to true, then the user is
 * asserting that a surface source has been defined that is conformal to a
 * geometric surface.  This means that new particles that are born from
 * this source will use conformal logic to determine the first mesh cell
 * that is crossed.  The default value for this option is false.
 *
 * 5) "tag"="name", "tagval"="value"
 * ---------------------------------
 * The "tag" and "tagval" options can be used to define a subset of the mesh
 * elements in the input file that will be tallied.  These tags are defined
 * on the input mesh itself using the MOAB tagging feature.  Note that "tag"
 * name can only be set once, whereas multiple "tagval" values can be added.
 * This option is only used during setup to define the set of tally points.
