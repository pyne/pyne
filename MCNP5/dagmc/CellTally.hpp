/**
 * \class CellTally
 * \brief Defines a simple CellTally interface
 *
 * CellTally is a concrete class derived from Tally that provides a simple
 * cell-based tally implementation.  Two types of cell tallies can be created
 *
 *     1) TallyEvent::COLLISION cell tally, based on particle collisions
 *     2) TallyEvent::TRACK cell tally, based on full particle tracks
 *
 * This class was designed to be used primarily for unit testing purposes, but
 * can also be used as a fully-functioning cell tally within a Monte Carlo
 * particle transport simulation.  Both energy bins and tally multipliers are
 * supported.
 *
 * ==========
 * TallyInput
 * ==========
 *
 * The TallyInput struct needed to construct a CellTally object is defined
 * in Tally.hpp and is set through the TallyManager when a Tally is created.
 * Options that are currently available for CellTally objects include
 *
 * 1) "cell"="value"
 * -----------------
 * Sets the cell ID to the given value, which should represent the index of an
 * actual geometric cell.  Currently only one cell can be tallied per CellTally,
 * and the default value is 1.
 *
 * 2) "volume"="value"
 * -------------------
 * Sets the volume for the cell ID that will be used to normalize the final
 * tally result.  Note that this quantity is not computed by the CellTally,
 * and the default value is 1.0.
