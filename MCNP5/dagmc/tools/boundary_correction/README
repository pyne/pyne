KDE Boundary Correction Tool
============================

The boundary correction tool is a prototype for modifying input meshes to
identify boundary points that require correction for KDE mesh tallies.  This
tool determines the distance to the upper and lower boundaries in each
dimension using the ray-fire method in the DAGMC toolkit.  Rays are fired in
all six axis-aligned directions at all calculation points in the input mesh
to find which ones lie within one bandwidth of the six external geometrical
boundaries.  Once these distances are computed, they are then tagged to the
mesh as follows:

    1. DISTANCE_TO_BOUNDARY (x, y, z): stores nearest distances to boundary
    2. BOUNDARY (x, y, z): lower = 0, upper = 1, none = -1

Note that if any dimension has a BOUNDARY tag value of -1, then the value in
DISTANCE_TO_BOUNDARY corresponding to that dimension is not defined.

This boundary correction tool will only need to be used once per input mesh
per input geometry per bandwidth vector.  It could be added to the setup phase
of the KDEMeshTally class, but for now it is a standalone tool that must be run
prior to running any KDE mesh tally with the boundary correction option.

Building the executable
-----------------------

1. Create a new directory: mkdir build ; cd build
2. Run the configure script: ../configure.sh
3. Build the 'boundary.exe' executable: make

Using the boundary correction tool
----------------------------------

The command for running the boundary correction tool is:

    boundary.exe <input_mesh.h5m> <input_geometry.h5m> <hx hy hz>

where (hx, hy, hz) is the bandwidth vector that will be used with the KDE
mesh tally.  When running the KDE mesh tally be sure to include the 'boundary =
default' key-value pair in the tally options.

The output file 'ouput_mesh.h5m' includes the original input mesh with the
DISTANCE_TO_BOUNDARY and BOUNDARY tags added.
