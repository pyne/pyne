 * \class Tally
 * \brief Defines an abstract Tally interface
 *
 * Tally is an abstract Base class that defines the variables and methods
 * needed to implement a generic Tally for use in Monte Carlo particle
 * codes.  All Derived classes must implement the following methods
 *
 *     1) compute_score(const TallyEvent& event)
 *     2) end_history()
 *     3) write_data(double num_histories)
 *
 * These three update methods are called by TallyManager (Observable) for all
 * Tally objects (Observers) that have been added.
 *
 * Note that Tally provides a default end_history() method that should be
 * sufficient for most Tally objects that use the TallyData structure for
 * storing their data.  If a different data structure is used, or alternative
 * behavior is desired, then Derived classes can override this method.
