/**
 * \class TallyManager
 * \brief Defines an interface for managing all DAGMC tallies
 *
 * TallyManager is the interface that allows any Monte Carlo physics code to
 * use DAGMC tallies instead of their native implementations.  DAGMC tallies
 * can be added and removed using addNewTally() and removeTally() respectively.
 * TallyManager maintains a list of all currently active tallies, each defined
 * by a unique tally ID number.
 *
 * DAGMC tally types that are currently available include
 *
 *     "unstr_track": Unstructured tracklength mesh tally (TrackLengthMeshTally)
 *     "kde_coll": KDE collision mesh tally (KDEMeshTally)
 *     "kde_subtrack": KDE sub-track mesh tally (KDEMeshTally)
 *     "kde_track": KDE integral-track mesh tally (KDEMeshTally)
 *     "cell_coll": Simple collision-based cell tally (CellTally)
 *     "cell_track": Simple track-based cell tally (CellTally)
 *
 * See the individual implementations for a more detailed description and a
 * list of all available tally options for that particular tally type.  The
 * tally options are all stored as key-value pairs in a multimap, which may
 * be empty if no options are requested.
 *
 * NOTE: The DAGMC Tally implementation is based on the Observer pattern.
 * TallyManager acts as the Subject/Observable, whereas Tally objects act as
 * the Observers.  All Tally actions are performed through the TallyManager.
 *
 * ==========================
 * TallyManager Functionality
 * ==========================
 *
 * Once a list of DAGMC tallies has been created, there are a series of actions
 * that can then be performed to compute the scores and write the results for
 * all currently active tallies.  The first step is to set an event type using
 * either setCollisionEvent() or setTrackEvent().  This can be done during
 * the Monte Carlo simulation as each event occurs, or during post-processing
 * if the complete particle history data is available.
 *
 * After an event type has been set, the TallyManager can then be used to
 * updateTallies().  This will compute the scores for all currently active
 * tallies, based on the tally event data that was set.  If a particular event
 * type is not compatible with a specific DAGMC tally type, then nothing will
 * happen and the code will move on to the next tally in the list.  Note that
 * when updateTallies() has updated all of the tallies it will then reset the
 * event data using clearLastEvent().
 *
 * As each particle history is completed, the endHistory() method should be
 * called through the TallyManager.  This adds the current sum of scores to
 * the total for each tally that is currently active.  It is also important
 * for calculating the relative standard errors in the final tally results,
 * and may perform other functionality as needed based on the tally type.
 *
 * When all particle histories have been scored, the final step is to use the
 * writeData() method to write all of the tally results and their corresponding
 * relative standard errors to an output file.  These results are typically
 * normalized by the number of histories reported by the physics code.
 *
 * =================
 * Tally Multipliers
 * =================
 *
 * TallyManager also includes optional support for energy-dependent tally
 * multipliers.  These multipliers are defined by a unique ID determined by
 * the user, and are stored separately to the list of Tally objects so that
 * multiple tallies can use the same multiplier ID.
 *
 * To use multipliers, simply add them using addNewMultiplier() and then assign
 * them to a specific Tally using addMultiplierToTally().  This will store the
 * multiplier ID in the Tally so that it has access to that multiplier during
 * the transport process for computing its scores.  As the multiplier values
 * change, use updateMultiplier() to update their values in the TallyManager.
