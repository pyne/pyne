 this tally meets the statistical criteria used to form confidence intervals: check the tally fluctuation chart to verify.
 the results in other bins associated with this tally may not meet these statistical criteria.

 if the largest  history score sampled so far were to occur on the next history, the tfc bin quantities would change as follows:

      estimated quantities           value at nps           value at nps+1           value(nps+1)/value(nps)-1.

 the estimated slope of the  50 largest  tallies starting at  7.75741E+01 appears to be decreasing at least exponentially.
 the large score tail of the empirical history score probability density function appears to have no unsampled regions.

 fom = (histories/minute)*(f(x) signal-to-noise ratio)**2 = (6.172E+04)*( 1.624E+00)**2 = (6.172E+04)*(2.637E+00) = 1.627E+05
