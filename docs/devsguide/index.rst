Developer's Guide
=================
Welcome to the PyNE Developer's Guide!  This is a place for developers to place
information that does not belong in the user's guide or the library reference
but is useful or necessary for the next people that come along to develop PyNE.

Developers can use the pages here to set the framework for the packages and
modules they work on, and make clear their design decisions, so that future
work builds upon past work well.
