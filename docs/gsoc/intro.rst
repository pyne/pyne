Information for Students
==========================

These ideas are features that are desired among our community of developers and 
users. They are typically related to an issue in the github repository. You are 
encouraged to browse those issues to find more information about these projects.  
Additionally, there are more desired feature issues where these came from. If 
you see one among the issues in the repository,  don't hesitate to suggest it to 
us. The PyNE developers can always be contacted on the listhost at 
pyne-dev@groups.google.com.

We really look forward to your interest as a Google Summer of Code student and 
we hope that you'll contact us if you have an interest in working with PyNE. If 
you are in a physics or engineering discipline, you will be especially suited to 
this coding effort. If not, you are certainly still welcome to contribute, as 
there are many computer science driven needs within the PyNE code base.
