==================================
Experimental Nuclear Data Project
==================================

The experimental nuclear data project will enable experimentalists to add data 
such as cross sections to the PyNE framework easily and to run specific, 
built-in comparisons against standard data. 


Brief explanation:
------------------

For an experimentalist, having a tool with which to compare their experimental 
data set with standard datasets is extraordinarily important. PyNE can be that 
tool because of the available data_source.py interface. 

However, a built-in tool for automated data comparison is still needed. The PyNE 
toolkit should include functionality for comparing two data sources.

Expected results:
------------------

* A review of the current 'data_source.py' interface with small experimental datasets in mind.
* An IPython notebook, for the example documentation gallery, demonstrating how 
  an experimentalist can import their experimental nuclear data into a PyNE 
  analysis (using the data_source API).
* Development of methods that generate relevant statistical comparisons of any 
  data in the small experimental dataset against available data in other PyNE 
  source.
* An Ipython notebook, for the example documentation gallery, demonstrating how 
  an experimentalist would use these functions to compare their data to known 
  sources. 


Knowledge Prerequisites:
------------------------

Necessary :

*  Intermediate level python familiarity.
*  Beginner or intermediate level C++ familiarity.
*  Beginner knowledge of version control.

Desired : 

*  An undergraduate degree in physics, nuclear engineering, computer science, or 
   related discipline.
*  Familiarity with nuclear data sources and experiments.
*  Familiarity with HDF5 and pytables.
