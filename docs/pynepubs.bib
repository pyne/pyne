	abstract = {This paper serves two purposes. First it demonstrates the validation of newly developed and verified burnup code, Linkage of ORIGEN and OpenMC (LOOP) against measured data of Post Irradiation Experiments (PIE) performed at Takaham-3 PWR. Secondly, it assesses the qualification of OpenMC model of Chashma Nuclear Power Plant unit-II (CNPP-II) PWR to predict different operating conditions of the reactor core. The LOOP code is then employed to perform the burnup simulations of CNPP-II first cycle with fresh UO2 fuel. The LOOP calculated results of power distribution of the first cycle at Beginning of Cycle (BOC), Middle of Cycle (MOC) and End of Cycle (EOC) are then compared with the operational data of the reactor. The maximum difference between the LOOP calculated radial and axial power distribution results and the measured data is 9.1\% and 2.3\% at BOC. At EOC, this difference further decreases to 7.2\% and 1.5\%. The depletion of burnable poison rods in the reactor was also compared with the FSAR predicted data which are in exact agreement with each other. The production of Cs-137 and Cs-134 was also investigated for the validity of LOOP burnup simulations.},
