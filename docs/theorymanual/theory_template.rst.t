This page presents a detailed explanation of how :py:mod:`THIS_THING` works, including
underlying theory, any assocaited assumptions, and information about correct and
appropriate use of this physics. 


*****************************
Descriptive Heading of Method
*****************************

Mathematical Details, some example math syntax:

You can use LaTeX format in rst. To do inline expressions (what $expression$ would
do in LaTeX) :math:`A\vec{x} = \vec{b}`.

To have blocks of mathematical content, do this

.. math::
    
    A\vec{x} = \vec{b}

Support is limited to a subset of LaTeX math by the conversion required for many output formats.

***********
Assumptions
***********

Any assumptions (explicit or implicit) about this method that would impact use, conclusions, validity, etc.
