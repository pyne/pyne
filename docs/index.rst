PyNE, or Python for Nuclear Engineering, is a suite of tools to aid in 
computational nuclear science & engineering.  PyNE seeks to provide 
native implementations of common nuclear algorithms, as well as Python
bindings and I/O support for other industry standard nuclear codes.

Please email us at pyne-users@googlegroups.com if you have any questions 
on how to use or install PyNE.
