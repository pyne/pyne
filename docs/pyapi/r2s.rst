Mesh-based Rigourous 2-Step Activation -- :mod:`pyne.r2s`
==============================================================

.. currentmodule:: pyne.r2s

This module contains functions for mesh-based Rigorous 2-Step activation [1]
using MCNP for neutron and photon transport and ALARA for nuclear inventory
analysis. The functionality of the module can be obtained by importing as
such::

    from pyne import r2s
