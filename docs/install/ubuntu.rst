Ubuntu build script
=================================

Scripts for installing PyNE and all its dependencies from scratch on Ubuntu
18.04 and 20.04 are found `here
<https://github.com/pyne/install_scripts/>`_.

In this repository, you will find both bash scripts and dockerfiles for Ubuntu.
These scripts will install PyNE and its dependencies to either your device
or an image. Docker allows users to build these images and to operate them separate 
from the rest of your device. You can download Docker `here 
<https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_.

For information on how to use these scripts, go to the install_scripts 
`README <https://github.com/pyne/install_scripts/blob/main/README.md>`_.
