=================================

The PyNE VirtualBox is an Ubuntu 18.04 VirtualBox with PyNE (SHA #371b4b6) preinstalled. In order to setup
the VirtualBox follow these steps:

  #. Install Oracle `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_.
  #. Download the PyNE VirtualBox (.ova) file `here <https://uwmadison.box.com/shared/static/gf1sgbjop6qkmk8ll76b7aw1tj0uo573.ova>`_. 
     This file is 2.5 GB so this may take a while.
  #. Open Oracle VirtualBox. Click File -> Import Appliance, then open the `pyne-0.7.0_ubuntu-20.04.ova` file.
  #. Follow remaining onscreen instructions.
  #. The VirtualBox can then be started up by clicking the Start arrow. The PyNE installation
     is in the /home/pyne-user/.local folder and the Pyne source can be found in
     /home/pyne-user/pyne.
  #. Email any questions to pyne-users@googlegroups.com.

The default password for the user "pyne-user" is "pyne".
