Simple Simulation Input Definitions -- :mod:`pyne.simplesim`

not intended to replace an understanding of the manual for any code you want to
run a simulation in.

Examples that are too complicated are useless, but all features still need to
be shown. It's better to have many small examples than to have a few big ones.

*******
Purpose
*******
Some may feel that it is fairly easy and straight-forward to create input files
for the popular codes in nuclear science and engineering. However, the
following functionality may be desirable:

1. 

*****
Usage
*****
An input file is generated by the following procedure:

1. System-related cards are created directly.
    a. Material cards.
    b. Surface cards.
    c. Regions are formed from the surfaces using :py:attr:`ISurface.neg`,
       :py:attr:`ISurface.pos`, and the overloaded operators ``&`` (the magic
       method ``__and__``) and ``|`` (the magic method ``__or__``).
    d. The regions (surface combinations) and materials are combined into cells.
2. The cell cards are added to a :py:class:`definition.SystemDefinition` using
   :py:meth:`definition.SystemDefinition.add_cell`. This automatically adds the
   necessary materials and surfaces to the system.
    a. If the user wants to provide materials or surfaces in the system that
       are not used in cells, they can do so manually using
       :py:meth:`definition.SystemDefinition.add_material` and
       :py:meth:`definition.SystemDefinition.add_surface`.


x. Modify the input (i.e. for parameter studies).

when card  names need to be unique


*********
Modifying
*********

In general, a definition, or the cards that make up the definition, can be modified at any point, and a new input file can be generated with these changes. This facilitates 

Explain a possible use scenario for manipulating a reactor: have a script that
creates the reactor, and have scripts that analyze results, etc...

search for mcnp name and you will find the card.

It is expected that when using this package, the user has the library
reference, at :ref:`pyne_simplesim`, open. The reference contains descriptions
and examples of every card that is implemented.

If you are interested in developing this package
further or are looking for information about the state of development, visit
:ref:`devsguide_simplesim` and/or contact the developers.
