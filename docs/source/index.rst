Welcome to PyNE's documentation!
================================
PyNE, or Python for Nuclear Engineering, is a suite of tools to aid in 
computational nuclear science & engineering.  PyNE seeks to provide 
native implementations of common nuclear algorithms, as well as Python
bindings and I/O support for other industry standard nuclear codes.

PyNE development is a continuing effort and we are always looking for
more developers, testers, and users.  If you are interested in being
involved with this project, please contact us via pyne-dev@googlegroups.com, 
`github`_, or `convore`_.

PyNE has the following dependencies:

   #. `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_
   #. `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_
   #. `HDF5 <http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_
   #. `PyTables <http://www.pytables.org/>`_

The source code for PyNE may be found at the `GitHub project site`_. 
Or you may simply clone from the official repo using git::
