PyNE: The Nuclear Engineering Toolkit
=====================================
PyNE, or Python for Nuclear Engineering, is a suite of tools to aid in 
computational nuclear science & engineering.  PyNE seeks to provide 
native implementations of common nuclear algorithms, as well as Python
bindings and I/O support for other industry standard nuclear codes.

PyNE development is a continuing effort and we are always looking for
more developers, testers, and users.  If you are interested in being
involved with this project, please contact us via pyne-dev@googlegroups.com, 
or `github`_.

The source code for PyNE may be found at the `GitHub project site`_.
