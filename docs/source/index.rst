PyNE: Python for Nuclear Engineering
=====================================
PyNE, or Python for Nuclear Engineering, is a suite of tools to aid in 
computational nuclear science & engineering.  PyNE seeks to provide 
native implementations of common nuclear algorithms, as well as Python
bindings and I/O support for other industry standard nuclear codes.

PyNE development is a continuing effort and we are always looking for
more developers, testers, and users.  If you are interested in being
involved with this project, please contact us via pyne-dev@googlegroups.com, 
or `github`_.

The source code for PyNE may be found at the `GitHub project site`_. 
For a quick install from source, please  clone from the official repo::

    git clone git://github.com/pyne/pyne.git
    cd pyne/
    python setup.py install --user
    nuc_data_make
