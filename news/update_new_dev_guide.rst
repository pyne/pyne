**Added:** None

**Changed:**
*new_dev_guide.rst: The update adds information about creating an environment (something I found useful in building the
website and using PyNE because I previously installed Anaconda 3.7), updates formatting for more consistency, details
considerations and methods to check the version of dependencies (a problem noted in many issues I've read), and adds
additional links to coding resources.

**Deprecated:** None

**Removed:** None

**Fixed:** None

**Security:** None
