228TH cG E(P)      A |g of this energy was seen in {+228}Pa decay and placed    
228TH2cG here in level scheme; however, the |g's deexciting the final level of  
228TH3cG this |g were not seen in {+228}Pa decay                                
228TH cG E(Q)      |g's of approximately same energy and intensity seen in both 
228TH2cG {+228}Ac and {+228}Pa decays. On the basis of coin with 911|g, it is   
228TH3cG suggested in {+228}Ac decay, that the |g feeds the 2+ 968.968 level. In
228TH4cG {+228}Pa decay, the |g is placed feeding the 3- 968.368 level. The     
228TH5cG energy fit is much better feeding the 3- level. Possibly the |g seen   
228TH6cG is a doublet feeding both the 968 and 969 levels. I|g(doublet)=24 {I6},
228TH7cG E(doublet)=674.65 {I5}.                                                
228TH cG RI(R)     There is a disagreement in the ratio I|g(583|g/I|g(651|g)    
228TH2cG between {+228}Ac decay (1.23 {I15}) and {+228}Pa decay (2.26 {I24}).

228TH cG E(R)      |g's of approximately same energy and intensity are reported

228TH4cG 968.97 level. In {+228}Pa decay, the |g is placed feeding the 3-       
228TH5cG 968.37 level. The energy of the |g (E|g=674.65 {I5}) agrees with decay 
228TH6cG to the 968.37 level. Possibly the |g is a doublet feeding both the     
228TH7cG 968.97 and 968.37 levels. I|g(doublet)=0.101 {I8}

228TH3cG is I|g=0.0031 {I4} from branching ratio in {+228}Pa decay. Therefore,  
228TH4cG the the 853.17 {I10} |g with I|g=0.0119 {I18} reported by 1987Da28     
228TH5cG seems to be a doublet with part of the intensity belonging to a |g
