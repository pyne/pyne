# Path to MCNP MESHTAL file containing neutron fluxes or a DAG-MCNP5
# unstructured mesh tally .h5m file.
meshtal: meshtal
# Tally number within the meshtal file containing the fluxes for activation.

# The name of the tag used to store flux data on the mesh. For unstructured
# mesh this tag must already exist within the file specified in <meshtal>.

# Path to the DAGMC material-laden geometry file (.h5m).
geom: geom.h5m
# If True the fluxes in the fluxin file will be printed in the reverse
# order of how they appear within the flux vector tag. Since MCNP and
# the Meshtal class order fluxes from low energy to high energy, this
# option should be true if the transmutation data being used is
# ordered from high-energy to low-energy.
reverse: True
# Number of rays to fire down each mesh row in each direction to calculate
# cell volume fractions.
num_rays: 100
# If true, rays will be fired down mesh rows in evenly spaced intervals.
# In this case <num_rays> must be a perfect square. If false, rays are fired
# down mesh rows in random intervals.
grid: True
